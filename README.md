* Introduction 
I give an introduction as why I have chosen this dataset.

* Variables I have picked are explained.

* First coding section, imports being used are defined in the beginning. Then the number of players are defined based on requirement of the project. After I have set up the dataframe to be used and for the index to start at 1. Finally I have ran the dataframe from pandas.
