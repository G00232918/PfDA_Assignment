    "I am an amateur player snooker player, had intentions like most to be a professional in my younger days. The game still fascinates me like it did, the first time I went into a club. Many men and women play sports at an amateur and have tried to become professional in preparation and technique. There is much more information now where is helping people to understand how a professional prepares. I have always wondered what the relationship is with the data I have chosen, and I am going to investigate the main factors that can contribute to your ranking on the main tour. I will base the result on the ranking on the county standings."

    "Variables used:\n",
    "\n",
    "- practice - This is the number of the solo hours practice per season, for sports that have hand to eye coordination techniques this is important to get your technique sound. You need to have something that you can rely under pressure. For example, every player will have their own cue action and the best players will be able to the same steps for every shot. It’s very similar to golf.\n",
    "- match_practice - This playing somebody in a match in practice, the main benefit is that you get used to a match situation where you are under pressure if you miss. The calculation is for the year. \n",
    "\n",
    "For setting the range for the practice variables, I took the benchmark as 4 time world champion Mark Selby. He is a full time professional, who plays 6 hours a day. From my own knowledge that is more than likey correct and the professionals, take one day off. 36 hours a week and take approximately 4 weeks off. So the total practice time for professional is approximately 1728 hours per year. So as an amatuer, I would set the maximum time to practice as 860 hours overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have split the range of practice time in half for solo and match practice as this is the most common method used for players. \n",
    "\n",
    "- comps_seas - This is the comps that you play outside of the main tour which can events held by other organisations such Connacht or Irish associations.\n",
    "- comps_main - These are the competitions that are for the main tour which the ranking will be based on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prediction will be based on  four categories Q1 = 1-25, Q2 = 26-50, Q3 = 51-75 , Q4 = 76-100. In the offical rankings, they will be ranking for each player that cannot be shared but this is prediction based on quarter what the player should expect.\n",
